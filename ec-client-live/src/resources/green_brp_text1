BIOMETRIC RESIDENCE PERMIT AUTHENTICATION (PILOT) Check

This certificate confirms that the Biometric Residence Permit (BRP) with number ending as above was issued by the Home Office and has not been tampered with. 

You have confirmed that you are satisfied that the photo image displayed on the card, on this certificate and displayed enlarged on screen when you read the card is that of the person who has presented the document to you.
We will now conduct background checks in order to confirm that the document remains valid.  
If we find the document has been cancelled (eg. because it has been reported lost or stolen or the holderâ€™s related permission to stay in the UK has been cancelled) we will contact you within one working day. 

We will not contact you again if the document remains valid. 

You may choose to wait until one working day has passed before you employ the holder. If you decide to employ the holder before this time it will be at your own risk of possible action against you should we later contact you to advise that the document is not valid and the person in question does not have leave to be in the UK, or has leave which is subject to a condition preventing them from accepting the employment which you are considering offering. 

If the photographs shown on this certificate do not match that printed on the BRP, or they are not a likeness of the person who presented it or you have any concerns about the document and its holder report this as a possible fraudulent use of the BRP card by emailing us at: IntelLondonSouth@homeoffice.gsi.gov.uk.
